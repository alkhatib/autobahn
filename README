# autobahn
## automatic Hacker News front page output in terminal

### Why
I wanted to have up to date HN information, and I noticed I was opening my terminal a lot.
I used to have fortune readings in my terminal, but I figured it was better if I was able
to read HN headlines.

This was made simply in bash so as to not require many dependencies. It also requires some
tools found in *NIX including lc, tr, jq, curl, sed, awk, echo and bash.

### Installation
Add to .bashrc

Example:
```
bash ~/path/to/autobahn.sh
```

Then type `source .bashrc`

### Deletion
Remove from .bashrc
